# Enhanced Textures

The first ever texture pack for Muck!!!

This texture pack is pretty simple, really. I used AI to increase some textures' resolution by a factor of 2! 
Overall compression artifacts were removed and the result was hand processed by me to make sure everything was as good as it could get.

This mod is totally compatible with multiplayer play, as it only changes the textures of your game and won't affect any multiplayer features.

This mod is dependant on Terrain's SettingsApi mod. 

If you're like me and are a bit annoyed at how his new settings menu feel like, get my [BetterSettingsApi](https://muck.thunderstore.io/package/MrBoxxy/BetterSettingsApi/ "Thunderstore") mod for a feel closer to the original game.

## What was done

Added a new graphic's setting: "Use Enhanced Textures" (ON by default) which can be used to control whether you want to vanilla textures or the enhanced textures from this texture pack.

Nearly all textures of 3D assets were doubled in size! The only things that were not touched are textures with little to no change from upscaling (ex: textures of Daves, villagers, wheat, apples, etc...)

Will this texture pack blow you away? Surely not, as it is still the same textures as the vanilla game, only less pixelated and with fewer compression artefacts.

### Can I run this mod even if I don't have an high end PC?
This mod is still compatible with the different texture resolutions available in the graphics settings. Even though you might not be able to run the game smoothly while on Ultra, I encourage you to try it out at a lower resolution!
